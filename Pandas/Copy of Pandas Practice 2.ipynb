In this exercise, you will work with the Rick and Morty dataset to practice your data manipulation and analysis skills using Pandas. Please follow the instructions below carefully:\n","\n","1. **Understand the Dataset**: The dataset used in this Practice is related to the Rick and Morty TV show. Familiarize yourself with the dataset's structure and content before starting.\n","\n","2. **Read Each Question Thoroughly**: Each question in this Practice is designed to test different Pandas functionalities. Make sure you understand the requirements of each question before you begin coding.\n","\n","3. **Write Your Code in the Provided Cells**: For each question, a code cell is provided where you should write your solution. Do not modify any other cells or sections of the notebook.\n","\n","4. **Execute Your Code**: After writing your code in each cell, run the cell to check if your code produces the expected results. Verify that the output matches the requirements specified in the question.\n","\n","5. **Complete All Questions**: Ensure that you attempt and complete all the questions provided in the notebook. Each question is designed to test different Pandas skills and concepts.\n","\n","6. **Review Your Work**: Before submitting, double-check your answers and make sure all questions are addressed. Ensure that the notebook runs without errors and that all outputs are correct.\n","\n","7. **Download Your Notebook**: Once you have completed all the questions and verified your solutions, download the notebook file (.ipynb). You can do this by selecting `File` > `Download` > `Download .ipynb` from the Google Colab menu.\n","\n","8. **Submit Your Practice**: Upload the downloaded .ipynb file to the designated learning platform for submission.\n","\n","9. **Verify Submission**: Ensure that you have uploaded the correct file and that it is not corrupted. If you encounter any issues with the file, you may need to resubmit.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Good luck with your Practice!"],"metadata":{"id":"dsUmzMojjuxc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","locations_data_url = \"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/aiml/classical-ml/locations_dataset.csv\"\n","episodes_data_url = \"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/aiml/classical-ml/episodes_dataset.csv\"\n","character_data_url = \"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/aiml/classical-ml/characters_dataset.csv\"\n","\n","characters = pd.read_csv(character_data_url,index_col=0)\n","episodes = pd.read_csv(episodes_data_url,index_col=0)\n","locations = pd.read_csv(locations_data_url,index_col=0)"],"metadata":{"id":"yJV1aGlEvZFB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763374382708,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2050,"user":{"displayName":"ŞÜMÅŇŢH ŞŤÄŘĶ","userId":"10324279652203833371"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q1.
