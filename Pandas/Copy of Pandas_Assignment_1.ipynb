In this exercise, you will work with the CO2_Emissions_Canada2 dataset for Assignment your data manipulation and analysis skills using Pandas. Please follow the instructions below carefully:\n","\n","1. **Understand the Dataset**: The dataset used in this assignment is related to the CO2_Emissions_Canada2. Familiarize yourself with the dataset's structure and content before starting.\n","\n","2. **Read Each Question Thoroughly**: Each question in this assignment is designed to test different Pandas functionalities. Make sure you understand the requirements of each question before you begin coding.\n","\n","3. **Write Your Code in the Provided Cells**: For each question, a code cell is provided where you should write your solution. Do not modify any other cells or sections of the notebook.\n","\n","4. **Execute Your Code**: After writing your code in each cell, run the cell to check if your code produces the expected results. Verify that the output matches the requirements specified in the question.\n","\n","5. **Complete All Questions**: Ensure that you attempt and complete all the questions provided in the notebook. Each question is designed to test different Pandas skills and concepts.\n","\n","6. **Review Your Work**: Before submitting, double-check your answers and make sure all questions are addressed. Ensure that the notebook runs without errors and that all outputs are correct.\n","\n","7. **Download Your Notebook**: Once you have completed all the questions and verified your solutions, download the notebook file (.ipynb). You can do this by selecting `File` > `Download` > `Download .ipynb` from the Google Colab menu.\n","\n","8. **Submit Your Assignment**: Upload the downloaded .ipynb file to the designated learning platform for submission.\n","\n","9. **Verify Submission**: Ensure that you have uploaded the correct file and that it is not corrupted. If you encounter any issues with the file, you may need to resubmit.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Good luck with your Assignment!"],"metadata":{"id":"BIIFlHFNysS9"},"id":"BIIFlHFNysS9"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this code cell\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","co2_emission = \"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/new-assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/aiml/classical-ml/CO2_Emissions_Canada2.csv\"\n","\n","# Upload the data to colab before executing this code cell\n","data = pd.read_csv(co2_emission)"],"metadata":{"id":"jD2zHzWrlPr0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763970731706,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1055,"user":{"displayName":"ŞÜMÅŇŢH ŞŤÄŘĶ","userId":"10324279652203833371"}}},"execution_count":82,"outputs":[],"id":"jD2zHzWrlPr0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1.
